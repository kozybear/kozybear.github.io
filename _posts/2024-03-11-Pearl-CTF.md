## Overview
- Hi guys, this is my writeup for some challenges in PearlCTF 2024. Have a good day!

## Solution

### 1.pcap-busterz-1 (Forensics)
- Challenge: 

    ![Smile](/assets/posts/PearlCTF/pcap-busterz-1/pcap-busterz-1.png)

- After download file and try to strings, i saw somethings like this : 

    ![Smile](/assets/posts/PearlCTF/pcap-busterz-1/image3.png)

- Use ```wireshark``` and check : ```Statistics -> Endpoint -> IP V4```, i see huge number packet in IP : 172.31.122.157.

    ![Smile](/assets/posts/PearlCTF/pcap-busterz-1/image.png)

- After that, i filter stream by type : ```ip.addr == 172.31.122.157```. Follow it, we see like this :

- Extract it,we will have a file with form : ``` x = ?, y = ?, color = ? ```. I used this code below to decode them (with my friend GPT haha) :

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Read data from file
with open('out.txt', 'r') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()

# Initialize an empty list to store the points
points = []

# Parse the data
for line in lines:
    x, y, color = line.strip().split(',')
    x = int(x.split('=')[1])
    y = int(y.split('=')[1])
    color = color.split('=')[1]
    points.append((x, y, color))

# Create a blank image
img = np.full((100, 100), 255)  # Use a numpy array filled with 255 (white)

# Plot the points on the image
for point in points:
    x, y, color = point
    img[y][x] = 0 if color == 'black' else 255  # Use 0 for black, 255 for white

# Display the image
plt.imshow(img, cmap='gray', origin='lower')  # Use grayscale color map
plt.show()
```

- And we have this, scan and get the flag :

    -> flag : <b>*pearl{QR_rev0lution1ses_mod3rn_data_handl1ng}*</b>

### 2.Lost Letter (Osint)
- Challenge :

- We have this image: 

    ![Smile](/assets/posts/PearlCTF/lost-letter/letter2.png)

- I didn't do the previous challenge of this challenge so I asked the boss and he said he couldn't find anything for this challenge. I used Tineye and removed some parts of the photo. I paid attention to two parts: "PIN code - 5x5x2x" and the hidden address consisting of two letters "J and T". I searched GG : ```indian post office code``` and found [this website](https://data.gov.in/catalog/all-india-pincode-directory) .In file CSV, I noticed that only the ```Telangana``` region have ```5x5x``` format, so the last part of the flag would be ```Telangana```. Continue following the letter J. I see that both the PIN code ```5x5x2x``` and the letter J match ```Jagtial```.

- So i get the first part of the flag, try submit and it work.

    -> flag : <b>*pearl{jagtial_telangana}*</b>
