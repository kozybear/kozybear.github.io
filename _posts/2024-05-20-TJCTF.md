This my writeup for TJCTF challenges.Thanks for reading!

# Solution

## 1. forensics/conversations 
- The challenge gives us a pcap file. Open it with wireshark. As usual, I'll check if there's an extractable file, and this line caught my eye.

- Extract it, we can see like this :

- Well, try use strings and we got the flag

FLAG: *tjctf{I_bh0p_to_sk00l_1337}*

## 2. forensics/pals
- We get an image file for this challenge. After trying some tools like `strings,aperisolve` and not getting any result, I tried `stegsolve`. After some planes, we can see the flag.

## 3. forensics/thatsmyjam
