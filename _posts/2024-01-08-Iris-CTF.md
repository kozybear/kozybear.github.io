For my first CTF tournament of the year, I mainly considered challenges related to Misc, Osint, Forensics but most of them were difficult for me, so I could only do 2 Osint problems. Too bad for that.

# Solution

## 1. Czech where?
- The first challenge gave me a photo like below.

- I tried searching with GG images and got 1 [article](https://tabiichigo.livedoor.biz/archives/51921024.html) .Use GG map to searh `Golden Lane` and we got the name of street .

## 2. Personal Breach
- The challenge shows us 1 website.

- I initially confused it with the cybersecurity company `iris` lol. But when I read the age section, I adjusted my direction. I searched for `Iris Stein` and found her profile - Her [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/irisstein_station/) and [Linkedin page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iris-stein-57894b2a7/). Linkedin page helps me answer question number 3-> `Mountain Peak Hiring Agency`. Next I saw she mentioned her mother in an article. Tried searching her mother's name: `Elaina Stein` on google and I found her [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/people/Elaina-Stein/61555040318052/).

- At the bottom of the profile page we will see a pinned event and Elaina was born in 1996 -> she is `27` years old (answer to part 1).

- Attached is the hospital her mother mentioned. I used google images again and saw the name of the hospital -> `Lenox Hill Hospital`.

- Enter all the information and get the flag.

## 3. Away on Vacation
-   ![Smile](/assets/posts/IrisCTF2024/Away-on-Vacation/AwayonVac.png)
- We received a transcript for the mp3 file: Transcript: `Hello, you’ve reached Iris Stein, head of the HR department! I’m currently away on vacation, please contact my assistant Michel. You can reach out to him at michelangelocorning0490@gmail.com. Have a good day and take care`
- I did challenge number 3 first, so it seems like I got this associate's profile right away when he followed Iris on Insta. Looking closely at each photo he posted, we immediately get the flag.

- Looking up his gmail with `Epieos` also gives some results but doesn't seem to help with the flag.
