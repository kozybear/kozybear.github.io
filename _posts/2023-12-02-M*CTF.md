# *Stegano*
## 1. Rounds-meme

- The challenge consists of 6 boxes of different colors, as usual I used `strings` and `binwalk` but nothing. Color ? I suddenly thought of stegsolve which can adjust color. Use `java -jar stegsolve` and change different colors, you will see each part of the flag (not good for people with poor eyesight lol). Their order is similar to the existing numbers:

-> flag: *mtcf{h31lO_c0loRB11nD_P3op1e}*

## 2.Two-Twins

- The photo of the challenge looks quite normal like any other Stegano challenge. Tried with binwalk, strings + grep, stegsolve... to no avail. Trying with steghide, it produces another image file.

- When I opened it, I realized it was Braille (I once did a similar challenge on BuuOJ). Decode the characters in the image and we get the flag:

    -> flag : *mctf{EAVESDROPP1NG}*

# *Miscellanous*
## 1.My-good-friend
- Original string:

- I tried letting Bing AI identify which language, and the result returned was Pig Latin. I tried some decoding pages but they were often incomplete. Finally, I found [this website](https://piglatintranslator.net/to-english) and decoded the text: 
`Beeline is primarily an engineering company. Cooperation with technical universities of the country, such as MTUSI, is strategically Are important for us: joint projects and educational programs will 0u allow us to train oung specialists really with the necessary competencies for our horny tasks and jointly develop the field of telecommunications. Our man agreements involve various formats of interaction: the participation of beeline experts in the educational process, holding seminars and practical classes, workshops, open master classes. We are open to new ideas, because the tasks facing the company are very ambitious, and for students it is an opportunity to take part in promising research and already acquire experience in the profession during training. I am sure that such synergy contributes not only to the development of each of the partners, but to the industry as a whole,`

-   Hmm, it seems very normal. Tried using google or edge to search about it, but to no avail. I thought of Russia and this was their prize, so I tried Yandex, and after a while I found the original text. I saw that there were some differences between the two documents, so I checked the length of the two paragraphs and they were indeed different. Use the [check diff tool](https://www.diffchecker.com/text-compare/). I get other characters.

    - Try inserting `_` between words and putting it into flag formatting : 
        - MCTF{Are_0u_really_horny_man}

    - But it still says it's wrong. I tried checking the diff and the original text again, it seems like the letter `y` before `0u` is missing. Add and try again, we get the correct flag:

    -> flag: *MCTF{Are_y0u_really_horny_man}*

# *Joy*
## 1. lico-klava

- I receive a string of characters: `zaq1w3edc vfr45665432 5tgbnju7 76tgvbn 7898ik,.,m` . Try asking Bing and it answers that it is a string on the keyboard that can be connected. I tried concatenating the given string and got the following flag:
    ![Smile](/assets/posts/M*CTF/Liko-klava/kova.png)

    -> flag : *MCTF{MTUCI}*
