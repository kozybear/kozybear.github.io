HackAppAtoi takes place at 00:00 am December 8, 2023 - 16:00 pm December 9, 2023 (ICT). Well, this is the first time I have solved so many Osint problems. Most of them are quite easy and can be solved in a short time. Thanks for visiting my blog.

# Solution

## 1. Italian mails (Origins)? 
- From the original video I found a full video: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQijAuOjnF8). Watch until the end of the video and you will see this text.
Full text is: "Roma via f.acton" .

- I searched google map and used 360 mode to determine the exact location. It's an itercoop in Italy.
