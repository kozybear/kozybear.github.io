- I personally see this challenge more as an osint challenge.I was originally going to check with GG image but I decided to try exiftool first. Unexpectedly, the organizers gave a photo with coordinates. Just use GPS coordinates to get the exact coordinates.

FLAG: *n00bz{13.37,-13.37}*

## 2. Forensics/Disk Golf 
- The challenge was to provide a "Linux rev 1.0 ext4" file. I tried both volatility3 and mounting the file but failed. Until a team member suggested me to use `photorec` or `testdisk` and the problem was solved.Using testdisk and move to /home/johnhackerdoe, we will see 2 files including flag.txt and flag2.txt . Just extract the flag.txt file and decode the hex to get the flag.

## 3. Osint/Tail 
- Challenge: <br>

- I tried using GG image to search for the image given by the challenge but got no results. Then I tried Yandex image search. After a while of zooming back and forth I found this website:

- Searching for the airline name again, I found it was the airline I was looking for. And we can see its IATA code.
